		we encounter the idea of chance constantly in our everyday lives, whether it be running into a friend on the streets or finding a coin on the sidewalk. but how does the idea of chance translate when it comes to digital webistes?
		<br> this project explores the idea of chance and luck through games. each entry questions the idea of chance in coding through interactive visual based elements â€” are these games still considered as chance if they are coded?
