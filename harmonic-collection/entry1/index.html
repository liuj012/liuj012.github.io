					<strong>what is chance?</strong>

		<ol>
			<li> something happening by accident</li>
			<li> the probability of something occurring</li>
		</ol>

	  from the clocks telling us when to wake up, eat, and sleep, to the days of the week on the 
	  calendar telling us when to work or to relax, it's almost as though there is no 
	  room for accidents or chance.

	  was the idea of chance created just to make us believe that there's still room for exploration 
	  and distract us from the structured and formulated manner of the world? or is it real?

	  
	  this project aims to explore the idea of chance and it's connection with structure through coding.
