			&emsp;&emsp;House numbering was not introduced to make people’s orientation easier or to help foreign visitors. At a time when the modern state was taking shape, authorities were bothered with houses being cut off from the public world. A house would remain an obstacle barring tax and military authorities from systematic appropriation of the riches and resources inside unless there was a central addressing system. Even so, houses were not unaddressable before house numbers were introduced. Actually, houses did have addresses – the house names. However, these were not always evident since not every house had a plaque attached indicating its name. <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;Until the late medieval period there was no great need to give the exact address of a house. In societies where most relations were based on personal acquaintanceship, a person’s name and the estimated indication of a place was all that was thought necessary to find them.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;Knowledge of a certain address therefore remained at the local level, confined to the seigneury. State authorities laying claim to the resources harbored in individual houses depended on limited information being made available with the support of seigneurial officials whose interests, how-ever, often ran counter to those of the former. Moreover, even if house names had been visible, and even if there had been a register of house names, a name-based addressing system would nonetheless have posed problems. There were many identical house names, i.e. an object targeted by state authorities might have been missed owing to the confusion of houses because of homonymy.

			&emsp;&emsp;Before the grid, Manhattan had hills, streams, beaches, ponds, wetlands, rock formations, and cliffs <span class="letter" id="A">[A]</span>. Building out the grid involved significant reshaping of the land conditions, and although traces of some of these geographical features remain visible, it is only in early prints, and especially the British Headquarters Map, that the geography of the island can be seen.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;Between 1790 and 1810, Manhattan’s population tripled to just under 100,000. Driving this population growth was the port economy: during the same period, from 1790 to 1810, the value of exports from New York tripled, putting its revenues well ahead of other American ports.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;The Commissioners <span class="letter" id="B">[B]</span> were charged in 1807 with producing a plan to structure this growth. Transferring the straight lines of the 1811 plan from paper to terrain was a demanding process.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;The planners proposed a grid for this future city stretching northward from approximately Houston Street to 155th Street in the faraway heights of Harlem <span class="letter" id="C">[C]</span>. It was in many respects a heartless plan. There were virtually no parks or plazas. The assumption was that people would gravitate east and west along the numbered streets to the rivers when they wanted open space and fresh air, and not spend time moving north or south. That partly explains why there were only a dozen avenues. New York property values boomed thanks to the grid, which created the real estate market. In 1965 John Reps, an urban historian at Cornell, wrote in “The Making of Urban America” that the city commissioners “were moti-vated mainly by narrow considerations of economic gain.”<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;This effort was led by John Randel, Jr. over a period of 14 years, from 1807, when the commissioners appointed him as their secretary and surveyor, to 1820, when he completed a detailed atlas of the island. His careful measuring was conducted amid protests and litigation. Randel’s surveyors were regularly obstructed, attacked, and sued for damages for cutting branches to complete their work. Randel himself was often arrested for trespassing.I
