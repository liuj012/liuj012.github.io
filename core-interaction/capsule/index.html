				june 16, 2020<br><br>
				<div class="italics">i dreamt that me and a few other poeple from school were playing basketball. then we ended up at my house in taiwan in the garage. we were doing art with ms. misty*. then ms. misty went to the main house** to get something and a storm began. halfway through the storm, ha an*** told me i got my period so we were going to go to the main house to get pads but then it was too foggy and windy so we decided not to. while we were still staring at the house, it caught on fire and i was screaming for people to call an ambulance since ms. misty was still in teh house. no one could reach the hopsital phone. then grandpa arrived and i woke up.</div><br>
				it's interesting to reread this now (on mar 20, 2024) because i still remember exactly what the dream looked like. it's weird.<br><br>
				*ms. misty was my art teacher<br>
				**at my grandparents house in taiwan, they had a detached garage.<br>
				***ha an is my friend who i've known since 6th grade

				<div class="italics">i had a lemon meringue tart from saint honore</div><br>
				saint honore is a chain bakery in vietnam. i always had it at ciputra. ciputra is a gated community in west lake. a good amount of my friends lived there.<br><br>
				i remember when we would hang out, usually it would be the morning after a sleepover, we would make our way to saint honore and have ourselves a lemon meringue tart.

				june 21, 2020<br><br>
				<div class="italics">arriving to ho chi minh city </div><br>
				at the time, ho chi minh city was the most exciting place to be in my mind. although hanoi is the capital of vietnam, i always found it a little too business-y and serious. it was not the place for a teen to be!! ho chi minh city on the other hand...<br><br>
				this specific trip was also exciting because i was 16 and my parents finally let me travel on my ownâ€”i still had my younger sister with me, but still. i remember we stayed at my aunt's place, and my cousin would take the two of us out everyday to do silly little things. it was brunch everyday!

				june 29, 2020<br><br>
				<div class="italics">i dreamt that it was the last day of school and sam asked me to go to the roof and so i did. he told me that i needed to swallow this usb thing and i did. and then an* started running/charging at me and sam told me to jump of the roof with this laptop to destroy it and i had to swallow a chip too then i jumped and an started chasing me and i stole a care. then two other people started chasing me too. i stopped the car in this construction zone thing to lose the people who were following me. but then we ended up meeting in the middle and we decided to have a race. whoever wins gets the prize. during the race i find out that alisha marie was the host and madison beer was a contest and i said it wasn't fair since they're friends so it's cheating.</div><br>
				*an is a vietnamese name

				july 1, 2020<br><br>
				<div class="italics">going swimming at night<br>i just swam alone at night. i felt so peaceful floating on the water and looking up at the night sky. all i could hear was the running water. makes me want to write a poem about how i feel, too bad i'm terrible at wiritng poems</div><br>
				the summer of 2020 was one of the nicest and most relaxing summers i've ever had. i think maybe part of it is because of the lack of tourism because of covid. vietnam was so empty and nice. at this point, i had left ho chi minh city and reconvened with my parents at cam ranh, a beach town near nha trang in the middle of vietnam. we were staying at a resort that just opened, and we had a villa with a pool.

				<div class="italics">arriving at intercon in danang</div><br>
				the intercontinental hotel in danang is the most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in. i still think about it a lot. because of covid, there was a really good discount for the hotel and my dad had booked for us to stay there for a few nights, and they were the best nights of my life. everything about that place is incredible!!! you're in this secluded mountain area in danang, and there's a private beach, where across you can see the city of danang. and the sky is soo incredibly clear and the weather is beautiful and the place is a paradise.

				july 6, 2020<br><br>
				<div class="italics">driving a jet ski by myself</div><br>
				this is still at intercon. my dad's friend has a friend who lives in danang and owns jet skis. we were invited by them to go to this restaurant that was floating in the ocean, very secluded area, and he had his jet skis there for us to use. my dad's friend took me on the jet ski and we sped into the middle of the ocean and he gave me the opportunity to operate it on my own. it was a really nice day. we were just out on the open water. i think jet skis are a lot less scary when you're the one operating it.

				khoai me is essentially steamed cassava in coconut milk that is topped with a salty sesame mix. it's a treat from the southern part of vietnam and my aunt would always bulk buy it for me everytime i visited my grandparents in saigon (the south). i remember this time, my aunt had sent a big package of it to me in hanoi.

				chops is a restaurant in hanoi that has a few locations. it's known for it's gourmet burgers that you can get as sliders to try multiple or as a bigger/normal size. it used to only be in tay ho, a.k.a. west lake, which was a 30-40 minute drive from my home, but they had opened one that was only 15 minutes away.

				i have always loved playing the sims. when i first got my ipad, my sister and i would spend hours playing the sims freeplay. i was never allowed to buy the actual sims game for computer, but in feb 2020 i convinced my mom to buy it for me for my birthday. the first night i got it i had stayed up until 5 playing it, and then slept, and then woke up at 10 to continue playing.<br><br>
