				<div class="date">june 16, 2020 </div><br><br>
				<div class="italics">i dreamt that me and a few other poeple from school were playing basketball. then we ended up at my house in taiwan in the garage. we were doing art with ms. misty*. then ms. misty went to the main house** to get something and a storm began. halfway through the storm, ha an*** told me i got my period so we were going to go to the main house to get pads but then it was too foggy and windy so we decided not to. while we were still staring at the house, it caught on fire and i was screaming for people to call an ambulance since ms. misty was still in the house. no one could reach the hopsital phone. then grandpa arrived and i woke up.</div><br>
				it's interesting to reread this now (on mar 20, 2024) because i still remember exactly what the dream looked like. it's weird.<br><br>
				*ms. misty was my art teacher<br>
				**at my grandparents house in taiwan, they had a detached garage.<br>
				***ha an is my friend who i've known since 6th grade

				<div class="italics">i had a lemon meringue tart from saint honore</div><br>
				saint honore is a chain bakery in vietnam. i always had it at ciputra. ciputra is a gated community in west lake. a good amount of my friends lived there.<br><br>
				i remember when we would hang out, usually it would be the morning after a sleepover, we would make our way to saint honore and have ourselves a lemon meringue tart.

				<div class="date">june 21, 2020</div><br><br>
				<div class="italics">arriving to ho chi minh city </div><br>
				at the time, ho chi minh city was the most exciting place to be in my mind. although hanoi is the capital of vietnam, i always found it a little too business-y and serious. it was not the place for a teen to be!! ho chi minh city on the other hand...<br><br>
				this specific trip was also exciting because i was 16 and my parents finally let me travel on my own—i still had my younger sister with me, but still. i remember we stayed at my aunt's place, and my cousin would take the two of us out everyday to do silly little things. it was brunch everyday!

			<div class="entry" id="jun29">
				<div class="date">june 29, 2020</div><br><br>
				<div class="italics">i dreamt that it was the last day of school and sam asked me to go to the roof and so i did. he told me that i needed to swallow this usb thing and i did. and then an* started running/charging at me and sam told me to jump of the roof with this laptop to destroy it and i had to swallow a chip too then i jumped and an started chasing me and i stole a care. then two other people started chasing me too. i stopped the car in this construction zone thing to lose the people who were following me. but then we ended up meeting in the middle and we decided to have a race. whoever wins gets the prize. during the race i find out that alisha marie was the host and madison beer was a contest and i said it wasn't fair since they're friends so it's cheating.</div><br>
				*an is a vietnamese name

				<div class="italics">going swimming at night<br>i just swam alone at night. i felt so peaceful floating on the water and looking up at the night sky. all i could hear was the running water. makes me want to write a poem about how i feel, too bad i'm terrible at wiritng poems</div><br>
				the summer of 2020 was one of the nicest and most relaxing summers i've ever had. i think maybe part of it is because of the lack of tourism because of covid. vietnam was so empty and nice. at this point, i had left ho chi minh city and reconvened with my parents at cam ranh, a beach town near nha trang in the middle of vietnam. we were staying at a resort that just opened, and we had a villa with a pool.

				<div class="italics">arriving at intercon in danang</div><br>
				the intercontinental hotel in danang is the most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in. i still think about it a lot. because of covid, there was a really good discount for the hotel and my dad had booked for us to stay there for a few nights, and they were the best nights of my life. everything about that place is incredible!!! you're in this secluded mountain area in danang, and there's a private beach, where across you can see the city of danang. and the sky is soo incredibly clear and the weather is beautiful and the place is a paradise.

				<div class="italics">driving a jet ski by myself</div><br>
				this is still at intercon. my dad's friend has a friend who lives in danang and owns jet skis. we were invited by them to go to this restaurant that was floating in the ocean, very secluded area, and he had his jet skis there for us to use. my dad's friend took me on the jet ski and we sped into the middle of the ocean and he gave me the opportunity to operate it on my own. it was a really nice day. we were just out on the open water. i think jet skis are a lot less scary when you're the one operating it.

				<div class="italics">baked banana bread and made pancakes</div><br>
				with nothing to do most days during covid, i started baking almost everyday. i can't remember what recipe i would use for banana bread, but i would usually go on sally's baking addiction website.<br>
				my mom loved the brownies i used to make, and i found out that the best way to make them really soft was to half the amount of cocoa powder that the recipe asked for and bake it for a little less.

				khoai me is essentially steamed cassava in coconut milk that is topped with a salty sesame mix. it's a treat from the southern part of vietnam and my aunt would always bulk buy it for me everytime i visited my grandparents in saigon (the south). i remember this time, my aunt had sent a big package of it to me in hanoi.

				nick is one of my closest friends. there was usually not much to do in hanoi, i think it's mostly cause i grew up there and at some point you run out of things to do with your friends. so we usually just thrifted. nick got a motorbike for his birthday and we would just bike around hanoi going from store to store.

				i have always loved playing the sims. when i first got my ipad, my sister and i would spend hours playing the sims freeplay. i was never allowed to buy the actual sims game for computer, but in feb 2020 i convinced my mom to buy it for me for my birthday. the first night i got it i had stayed up until 5 playing it, and then slept, and then woke up at 10 to continue playing.<br><br>
				the seasons expansion pack was the first dlc i was able to get, and it's led to many more purchases...

				<div class="italics">went to hoan kiem with my family</div><br>
				hoan kiem is a lake that's in the center of hanoi. it's where everything is at. on weekends, the roads closes and the lake is open to people only. vendors would set up street side seating area where you could get drinks or food by the lake. during summer, with the humidity, it would sometimes get a little too insufferable. but during winter, it was always really nice to just walk around, especially being in a city where there aren't really sidewalks and parks.

				<div class="italics">eating poke</div><br>
				there's a restaurant in hoan kiem in hanoi called poke hanoi. a bowl would cost around 180k vnd which is equivalent to a little less than $10 usd. they would always really fill up the bowl, and you could get as many topping as you would like. and you get a free bowl of miso soup with each order. it was located in this little alleyway, which looks a little scary to enter. but it quickly became one of my go-to restaurant spots.

				<div class="italics">having dinner at jw</div><br>
				dinner at jw marriott was a special occasion. the buffet always had the best desserts and pastas, and also indian food. i don't know when or how it happened, by my younger sister and i have had an unspoken rule that we always have to get food together at a buffet. if one of us finishes a plate before the other, we have to wait.

				<div class="italics">taking a day off school</div><br>
				remember when i mentioned that i got traumatized by my volleyball coach and never played again after that. well, the day before this was when it happened. and i had gone home and had my first mental breakdown and begged my parents to let me skip school for a day. they took me into town to hoan kiem, and we had a nice lunch together.

				<div class="italics">going on a field trip for environmental science</div><br>
				i really loved my environmental science class. we each had group projects where we would focus on an environmental issue. mine was on food waste, so my group and i planned a trip for our class where we went to a farm and learned about how vegetables are grown—how to plant, take care, and harvest them. and it was just a nice opportunity to get away from school and do something fun.

				<div class="italics">baking sugar cookies</div><br>
				sugar cookies take a really long time to bake but i think they're one of my favourites. my oven back at home, before we moved, was tiny. you could only ever bake 4 cookies at once so baking usually ended up taking an entire day or more. this was right before my winter break, and i ended up bringing the cookies with me when we traveled.

				<div class="italics">reading + finishing two books</div><br>
				we were at quy nhon, which is a little beach town that was starting to have hotels. and because it was just starting to get tourists, there wasn't much to do there, so i spent a good amount of my time there just reading in the hotel room. i think i was reading some random mystery novel about a kid getting kidnapped, but then they found out that the mom actually was the one who kidnapped the kid and she had planned it so that she could get away from her abusive husband.
