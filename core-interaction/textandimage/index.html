        	<img src="1.jpg" class="photo" id="one" alt="an image of a bird cage, taken in hoan kiem in hanoi, vietnam. the birds chirping remind me of being at my grandparents' house, my grandfather has a collection of birds. my mom says she doesn't understand his love for birds but i think it's quite sweet.">
        	<img src="2.jpg" class="photo" id="two" alt="this is an image of my baby cousin—she's actually my favourite cousin. it was taken in phu quoc on spring break, as we had lunch in a restaurant on stilts in the ocean. my baby cousin is a reminder of my childhood, being around her i feel like a little kid again. i can't remember what it was like being her age, but i'm glad i get to experience her childhood with her. she's the funniest and sweetest kid there is in the universe!!!">
        	<img src="3.jpg" class="photo" id="three" alt="this is an image of my parents. we were having lunch on a beach. they would've been more visible if i had remembered to use flash, but instead the camera focused on the bright blue sky behind them.">
        	<img src="four.jpg" class="photo" id="four" alt="this is hoi an, it's located in the middle of vietnam. it's known for being the city of lanterns, and at night the whole place lights up. it's an ancient town with buildings from the 1600s. the town is a reflection of vietnam's history, with architectural influences from china, japan, and european countries — reflecting vietnam's history with colonization. hoi an is one of the most beautiful places in vietnam. i think i see it as a reflection of vietnam's strength.">
        	<img src="5.jpg" class="photo" id="five" alt="this is an image of rocks in the clear ocean water in phu quoc. we were on a boat, going from beach to beach around this island. in this image, we had stopped at a beach that had a restaurant. i remember having to climb all these rocks just to get this image. the sky was so incredibly blue and the water was so clear.">
        	<img src="6.jpg" class="photo" id="six" alt="this is a postcard of phu quoc, an island located at the southern tip of vietnam. in this image, my mom is seen standing on a rock with the beach surrounding her. the image is a reminder of the beauty of vietnam. growing up there, i spent many years waiting for the day i'd get to leave, but images like these remind me of how special this country is, and reminds me to not take it for granted.">
